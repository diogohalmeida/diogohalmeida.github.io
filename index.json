Steering my academic journey accordingly, I graduated with a master\u0026rsquo;s degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering (Computer Science) from the¬†Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, laying a solid foundation for my professional journey ahead.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently working as a full stack software engineer at¬†Critical Techworks, where I have the exciting opportunity to develop¬†Cloud Data Hub: BMW Group\u0026rsquo;s data lake platform.\nI am deeply committed to continuous learning and professional growth. Whether by working on a challenging task at my job, exploring new projects, or diving into tech books and courses, I seek to expand my knowledge and stay at the forefront of the industry. I thrive on the excitement of solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions that make a difference.\nHere, you\u0026rsquo;ll find insights into some of my projects and a glimpse into my journey as I evolve as a software engineer.
