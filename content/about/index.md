## Hi, I'm Diogo!

From an early age, I developed a fondness for technology and computers that has only deepened over the years, and I can't recall a time when I didn't dream of turning this passion into a lifelong career. Steering my academic journey accordingly, I graduated with a master's degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering (Computer Science) from the [Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup), laying a solid foundation for my professional journey ahead.

I'm currently working as a full stack software engineer at [Critical Techworks](https://www.criticaltechworks.com/), where I have the exciting opportunity to develop [Cloud Data Hub](https://data.bmwgroup.com/): BMW Group's data lake platform.

I am deeply committed to continuous learning and professional growth. Whether by working on a challenging task at my job, exploring new projects, or diving into tech books and courses, I seek to expand my knowledge and stay at the forefront of the industry. I thrive on the excitement of solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions that make a difference.

Here, you'll find insights into some of [my projects](https://github.com/diogohalmeida?tab=repositories) and a glimpse into my journey as I evolve as a software engineer.
Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
